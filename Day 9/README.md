## **MongoDB**

-   is an open-source NoSQL database management prograM
-   stores document oriented information
-   commonly user with Node and Express (MEAN and MERN stacks).
-   works well with JavaScript
-   uses a JSON-like structured called BSON

## **Using MongoDB**

-   `Database` - holds collections
-   `Collection` - holds documents, synonymous with tables in SQL databases

    -   organized into tables
    -   allows the formation of relationships with other tables
-   `NoSQL`- document database
    -   eg. Mongodb, CouchDB, Cassandra, Neo4j, Redis
    -   is unstructured in general
    -   stores data in `key:value` pairs called documents
    -   more flexible compared to SQL
